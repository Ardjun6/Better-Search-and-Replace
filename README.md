- Case-sensitive replacement preserving the original text case
- Automated renaming of files and folders
- User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter
- Comprehensive summary upon completion of replacements

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with standard Python installations)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
2. Navigate into the directory:
```bash
cd better-search-and-replace
```

## Usage
Run the application using Python:
```bash
